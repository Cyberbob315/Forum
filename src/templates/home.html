                    useful for the beginners to get information related to
                    various topics. There is a centralized database in which
                    all the information is managed. The administrator acts as
                    the highest authority and has the rights to update the
                    database. There are also connected user who acts as an
                    intermediate user who can also answer the questions of the
                    end-user if they know it. The intermediate user can also
                    cache the information provided by the administrator to the
                    end-user. This cached information is useful when the same
                    question is repeated some another user , then the

                    end-user. Whenever the new information is arrived it is
                    updated by the end-user. The end-user is provided with the
                    access rights which is managed by the administrator. The
                    access to the database is provided to the end-user
